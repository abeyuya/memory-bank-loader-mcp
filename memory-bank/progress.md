## What Works

-   The `load-memory-bank` MCP tool is implemented and functional.
-   It correctly reads files recursively from a specified directory.
-   It sorts files according to the complex priority rules:
    1.  Root files first.
    2.  Priority root files (`projectbrief.md`, etc.) ordered specifically.
    3.  Other root files alphabetically by relative path.
    4.  Subdirectory files after root files, sorted alphabetically by relative path.
-   It formats the output string using the specified Markdown format:
    -   `# {relativePath}` headers.
    -   4-backtick code blocks (```` ``` ````) enclosing content (including empty content).
    -   `---` separators between file sections.
    -   No trailing separator.
-   Unit tests using Vitest cover all specified scenarios and are passing.
-   The project builds successfully using `npm run build`.
-   Memory Bank core files have been initialized and populated with initial content.
-   Project `README.md` has been created and refined based on functionality and examples.
-   Resolved `npm publish` warning by running `npm pkg fix`, which corrected the `bin` path format (removed leading `./`) and bumped the version to `1.0.3`. (Previously also renamed the `bin` command from `load` to `memory-bank-loader-mcp`).
-   `package.json` was further modified (likely during/after `npm publish`) bumping version to `1.0.4`, reverting `bin` command to `load`, and changing license to `MIT`.

## What's Left to Build (for this task)

-   Core functionality and initial documentation (including README and Memory Bank) are complete.
-   Further enhancements or error handling could be added if needed (e.g., handling binary files, more specific error reporting).

## Current Status

-   The `load-memory-bank` tool implementation is complete and tested according to the defined requirements.
-   The Memory Bank core files have been updated to reflect the current project state, including README creation.
-   Project `README.md` is up-to-date.
-   The `npm publish` process seems to have finalized `package.json` with version `1.0.4`, `bin` command as `load`, and license as `MIT`.

## Known Issues

-   None identified regarding the core functionality implemented so far.

## Evolution of Project Decisions

-   **Initial Goal:** Simple recursive file concatenation.
-   **TDD Introduced:** Adopted Vitest for TDD approach.
-   **Output Format v1:** Simple concatenation.
-   **Output Format v2:** Added `# {relativePath}` headers and `---` separators.
-   **Output Format v3:** Refined separator logic to avoid trailing `---`.
-   **Sorting Logic v1:** Simple alphabetical sort.
-   **Sorting Logic v2:** Introduced priority files (`projectbrief.md`, etc.).
-   **Sorting Logic v3:** Refined priority to apply only to root-level files.
-   **Sorting Logic v4:** Final logic - Root files first (priority then alpha), then subdirectory files (alpha).
-   **Output Format v4:** Switched to 4-backtick code blocks for content to prevent Markdown collisions.
-   **Memory Bank Init:** Populated core Memory Bank files.
-   **README Creation:** Added a `README.md` with project details.
-   **README Refinement:** Updated `README.md` based on examples and user feedback.
-   **Tool Description:** Refined the `load-memory-bank` tool description for clarity.
-   **.gitignore Update:** Added `build/` directory to `.gitignore` and removed tracked build files.
-   **npm Publish Fix (Attempt 1):** Renamed `bin` command from `load` to `memory-bank-loader-mcp`.
-   **npm Publish Fix (Attempt 2):** Ran `npm pkg fix` to correct `bin` path format and bump version to `1.0.3`.
-   **Post-Publish Changes:** Observed `package.json` updated to version `1.0.4`, `bin` reverted to `load`, and license changed to `MIT`.
