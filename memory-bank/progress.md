## What Works

-   The `load-memory-bank` MCP tool is implemented and functional.
-   It correctly reads files recursively from a specified directory.
-   It sorts files according to the complex priority rules:
    1.  Root files first.
    2.  Priority root files (`projectbrief.md`, etc.) ordered specifically.
    3.  Other root files alphabetically by relative path.
    4.  Subdirectory files after root files, sorted alphabetically by relative path.
-   It formats the output string using the specified Markdown format:
    -   `# {relativePath}` headers.
    -   4-backtick code blocks (```` ``` ````) enclosing content (including empty content).
    -   `---` separators between file sections.
    -   No trailing separator.
-   Unit tests using Vitest cover all specified scenarios and are passing.
-   The project builds successfully using `npm run build`.
-   Memory Bank core files have been initialized.

## What's Left to Build (for this task)

-   The core functionality requested for `load-memory-bank` is complete based on the latest requirements.
-   Further enhancements or error handling could be added if needed (e.g., handling binary files, more specific error reporting).

## Current Status

-   The `load-memory-bank` tool implementation is complete and tested according to the defined requirements.
-   The Memory Bank core files have been created with initial content reflecting the current project state.

## Known Issues

-   None identified regarding the core functionality implemented so far.

## Evolution of Project Decisions

-   **Initial Goal:** Simple recursive file concatenation.
-   **TDD Introduced:** Adopted Vitest for TDD approach.
-   **Output Format v1:** Simple concatenation.
-   **Output Format v2:** Added `# {relativePath}` headers and `---` separators.
-   **Output Format v3:** Refined separator logic to avoid trailing `---`.
-   **Sorting Logic v1:** Simple alphabetical sort.
-   **Sorting Logic v2:** Introduced priority files (`projectbrief.md`, etc.).
-   **Sorting Logic v3:** Refined priority to apply only to root-level files.
-   **Sorting Logic v4:** Final logic - Root files first (priority then alpha), then subdirectory files (alpha).
-   **Output Format v4:** Switched to 4-backtick code blocks for content to prevent Markdown collisions.
-   **Memory Bank Init:** Populated core Memory Bank files.
